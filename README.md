> 🛡️ *"Breach the stack. Secure the logic. Execute the mission."*  
> This isn't your ordinary language. This is **Siege Code** — a custom **stack-based** language written in **Python** where your commands are led by Operators from *Rainbow Six Siege*. 🤯

Whether you're breaching a door or pushing ASCII, you're in for an elite coding op. 🎖️🐍

## 🧠📜 Siege Protocol: **Operator Commands**

| 🪖 **Operator** | 💬 **Role in the Field (Command Behavior)** |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 🧱 **Tachanka** | 💡 **Mission Briefing.** Always **start** your script with `Tachanka <mode>`. This sets the tone for the operation. |
| 🔌 **Bandit**   | 🗯️ **Comms Mode.** Push letters with `Thermite`, then use `Azami` to decrypt and print the message. |
| 🏰 **Castle**   | 🏗️ **Sentence Constructor.** Turns ASCII stack values into readable sentences. Solid build. |
| 🩺 **Doc**      | 🔄 **Reversal Expert.** Prompts for input and reverses it. Good under pressure. |
| 🎯 **Glaz**     | 🎯 **Sniper Math.** Requests 2 numbers, multiplies them with precision. |
| ❄️ **Frost**    | 🔁 **Echo Trap.** Prompts for a word and how many times to repeat it. |
| 🔥 **Thermite** | 💥 **ASCII Charge.** Format: `Thermite 65` → pushes ASCII 'A' to the stack. |
| 🧤 **Azami**    | 🧷 **Print & Prompt.** Pops the top value and prints. Always use after `Thermite`. |
