## Siege Code Instructions

| Operator     | Description                                      |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Tachanka** | Always comes first. Use it with another word to pick a "mode" (like a task type). |
| **Bandit**   | Mode : Print out a message you can write with Siege Operators. When using this, you will write: Thermite "num" and it will get the ASCII value of that and turn it into a letter!  |
| **Castle**   | Mode : Takes in a sentence or a word and prints it for you to see!        |
| **Doc**      | Mode : Prompts user for input string and prints the reversed version |
| **Glaz**     | Mode : Asks for 2 numbers and will multiply them together and print out that number |
| **Frost**    | Mode : Asks for a word and how many times to repeat it. Then will repeat that many times|
| **Thermite** | Followed by an ASCII number to push |
| **Azami**    | pops value from the stack and it triggers user input prompt and prints the result |
