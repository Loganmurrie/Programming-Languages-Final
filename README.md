>  *"Breach the stack. Secure the logic. Execute the mission."*  
> This isn't your ordinary language. This is **Siege Code** — a custom **stack-based** language written in **Python** where your commands are led by Operators from *Rainbow Six Siege*. 

Whether breaching a door or pushing ASCII, you're in for an elite coding op.

##  Siege Protocol: **Operator Commands**

|  **Operator** |  **Role in the Field (Command Behavior)** |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------|
|  **Tachanka** |  **Mission Briefing.** Always **start** your script with `Tachanka <mode>`. This sets the tone for the operation. |
|  **Bandit**   |  **Comms Mode.** A Mode that lets you push letters with `Thermite`, then use `Azami` to decrypt and print the message. |
|  **Castle**   |  **Sentence Constructor.** A Mode that turns ASCII stack values into readable sentences. Solid build. |
|  **Doc**      |  **Reversal Expert.** A Mode that prompts for input and reverses it. Good under pressure. |
|  **Glaz**     |  **Sniper Math.** A Mode that will request 2 numbers, and then multiply them with precision. |
|  **Frost**    |  **Echo Trap.** A Mode that prompts for a word and how many times to repeat it, and will repeat it that many times. |
|  **Thermite** |  **ASCII Charge.** Format: `Thermite 65` → pushes ASCII 'A' to the stack. |
|  **Azami**    |  **Print & Prompt.** Pops the top value and prints. Always use after `Thermite`. |

##  Example Deployment

```python
Tachanka Bandit
Thermite 72
Azami
Thermite 101
Azami
Thermite 108
Azami
Thermite 108
Azami
Thermite 111
Azami
```

 **Expected Output:**  
```
Hello
```

##  Final Briefing

You’re not just writing code — you're launching missions.  
From `Glaz`'s math shots to `Doc`'s reverse tactics, every line is tactical.  
Deploy your `.siege` files, command your operators, and **let Siege Code breach the system**. 

>  *“Complete the Mission and Execute the Defuse, Operator.”*
