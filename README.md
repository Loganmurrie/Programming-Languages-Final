## 🧾 **Siege Code Cheat Sheet**

Here’s your tactical operator briefing:

| 🪖 **Operator** | 📋 **Functionality** |
|----------------|----------------------|
| **🧱 Tachanka** | **The Commander.** Must always be the **first word**. Use it like `Tachanka Bandit` to pick a mode. |
| **🔌 Bandit** | **Hello World Mode.** Push letters using `Thermite` ops, then use `Azami` to print the word's "Hello World"|
| **🏰 Castle** | **Sentence Mode.** Sets up a Castle and will print back to you the sentence or word you spelled using Thermite "num" |
| **🩺 Doc** | **Reverse Mode.** Enter a word or sentence, and Doc will revive you, but will REVERSE the output !  |
| **🎯 Glaz** | **Sniper Math.** He’ll ask for two numbers, throw a smoke bomb, and begin multiplying them together and print out the result  |
| **❄️ Frost** | **Repeater Mode.** Say a word and how many times you want it repeated—Frost will then drop down her frost mat, however many times you need her to (the frost mat being the word or sentence) |
| **🔥 Thermite** | **ASCII Charges.** Set A Breach Charge by using  `Thermite 65` to push the letter **A** to the stack. |
| **🧤 Azami** | **Stack Pop + Print.** Pops the top value from the stack like a kiva barrier, prompts for input, and prints it. Use right after `Thermite` for smooth ops. |
