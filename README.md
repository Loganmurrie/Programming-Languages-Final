## 🧾 **Siege Code Cheat Sheet**

Here’s your tactical operator briefing:

| 🪖 **Operator** | 📋 **Functionality** |
|----------------|----------------------|
| **🧱 Tachanka**     | **The Commander.** Must always be the **first word**. Use it like `Tachanka Bandit` to pick a mode. |
| **🔌 Bandit** | **Message Mode.** Push letters using `Thermite` ops, then use `Azami` to print them! |
| **🏰 Castle** | **Sentence Builder.** Converts your ASCII stack into full sentences. Clean and efficient. |
| **🩺 Doc** | **Reverse Mode.** Enter a word or sentence, and Doc will flip it backwards! |
| **🎯 Glaz** | **Sniper Math.** He’ll ask for two numbers, multiply them, and show you the result with precision. |
| **❄️ Frost** | **Repeater Mode.** Say a word and how many times you want it repeated—Frost handles the rest. |
| **🔥 Thermite** | **ASCII Charges.** Use like `Thermite 65` to push the letter **A** to the stack. Boom! |
| **🧤 Azami** | **Stack Pop + Print.** Pops the top value from the stack, prompts for input, and prints it. Use right after `Thermite` for smooth ops. |
