## Siege Code Instructions

| Operator     | Description                                      |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Tachanka** | Always comes first. Use it with another word to pick a "mode" |
| **Bandit**   | Mode: Print out a message you can write with Siege Operators.  |
| **Castle**   | Mode: Takes in a sentence or a word and prints it for you to see!        |
| **Doc**      | Mode: Prompts the user for input word or a sentence and prints the reversed version of that word or sentence |
| **Glaz**     | Mode: Asks for 2 numbers and will multiply them together and print out that number |
| **Frost**    | Mode: Asks for a word and how many times to repeat it. Then will repeat that many times|
| **Thermite** | When using this, you will write: Thermite "num" and it will treat that number as an ASCII value and turn it into a letter! |
| **Azami**    | Gets the letter that was just put on the stack, and it triggers a user input prompt and prints the result! ALWAYS USE THIS AFTER THERMITE "num"  |
