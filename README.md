#  Welcome, Operator, to the **Tom Clancy's Siege Interpreter** 

![Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege Code](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d791761-b406-42c8-aec7-851a7d941b51)

>  *"Breach the stack. Secure the logic. Execute the mission."*  
> This isn't your ordinary language. This is **Siege Code** — a custom **stack-based** language written in **Python** where your commands are led by Operators from *Rainbow Six Siege*. 

Whether you're breaching a door or pushing ASCII, you're in for an elite coding op.

## Installation

1.  Make sure you have **Python 3** installed.
2.  Clone the repo:
   ```python
   # Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/siege-interpreter.git
   cd siege-interpreter
   ```
3.  Run the interpreter:
   ```python
   # Run the interpreter with a script file
   python seige_interpreter.py helloworld.siege
   ```

##  Siege Protocol: **Operator Commands**

|  **Operator** |  **Role in the Field (Command Behavior)** |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------|
|  **Tachanka** |  **Mission Briefing.** Always **start** your script with `Tachanka <mode>`. This sets the tone for the operation. |
|  **Bandit**   |  **Comms Mode.** Push letters with `Thermite`, then use `Azami` to decrypt and print the message. |
|  **Castle**   |  **Sentence Constructor.** Turns ASCII stack values into readable sentences. Solid build. |
|  **Doc**      |  **Reversal Expert.** Prompts for input and reverses it. Good under pressure. |
|  **Glaz**     |  **Sniper Math.** Requests 2 numbers, multiplies them with precision. |
|  **Frost**    |  **Echo Trap.** Prompts for a word and how many times to repeat it. |
|  **Thermite** |  **ASCII Charge.** Format: `Thermite 65` → pushes ASCII 'A' to the stack. |
|  **Azami**    |  **Print & Prompt.** Pops the top value and prints. Always use after `Thermite`. |

##  Example Deployment

```python
Tachanka Bandit
Thermite 72
Azami
Thermite 101
Azami
Thermite 108
Azami
Thermite 108
Azami
Thermite 111
Azami
```

 **Expected Output:**  
```
Hello
```

##  Final Briefing

You’re not just writing code — you're launching missions.  
From `Glaz`'s math shots to `Doc`'s reverse tactics, every line is tactical.  
Deploy your `.siege` files, command your operators, and **let Siege Code breach the system**.
